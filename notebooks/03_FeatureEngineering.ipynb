    "\n",
    "Baseline modelin \"Recall: 0.00\" (Arızaları yakalayamama) sorununu çözmek amacıyla, bu notebook'ta ham veriye **zaman algısı** ve **trend bilgisi** kazandırılmıştır.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Uygulanan Dönüşümler (Engineering Steps)\n",
    "Modelin anlık gürültüden (Noise) etkilenmemesi ve büyük resmi görebilmesi için veri seti şu tekniklerle zenginleştirilmiştir.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Rolling Statistics (Hareketli İstatistikler):**\n",
    "    * Her sensör için **3 saatlik** ve **12/24 saatlik** (seçilen pencereye göre) hareketli ortalama (`mean`) ve standart sapma (`std`) türetildi.\n",
    "    * **Amaç:** Anlık titreşimleri filtreleyip, sensörün genel gidişatını (Isınıyor mu? Basınç artıyor mu?) modele göstermek.\n",
    "* **Lag Features (Gecikmeli Değişkenler):**\n",
    "    * Verilerin 1 saat önceki değerleri (`shift`) ile şu anki değerleri arasındaki farklar (`diff`) hesaplandı.\n",
    "    * **Amaç:** Değişim hızını (Velocity) yakalamak. Ani düşüş veya yükselişler artık matematiksel olarak ifade edilebilir durumda.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Görsel Doğrulama\n",
    "* Yapılan görselleştirmede, ham verinin (Gri Çizgiler) çok gürültülü olduğu, ancak türetilen **Rolling Mean** (Kırmızı Çizgi) özelliğinin ana trendi pürüzsüz bir şekilde takip ettiği gözlemlendi.\n",
    "* Bu durum, modelin artık \"sinyali\" gürültüden ayırt edebileceğini kanıtlamaktadır.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Hazırlanan Veri Seti\n",
    "* Türetilen özelliklerle sütun sayısı artırılmış ve zenginleştirilmiş veri seti **`data/processed/sensor_enriched.csv`** olarak kaydedildi.\n",
    "* Hedef değişken (`y`), arıza öncesi 24 saatlik pencere kuralına göre yeniden etiketlendi.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sonraki Adım:** Bu zenginleştirilmiş veri setini kullanarak **04_ModelOptimization.ipynb** aşamasında LightGBM/XGBoost modellerini eğitmek ve Baseline skorunu (Recall: 0.00) yukarı çekmek."
